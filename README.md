# my-first-proper-console-game

Hello stranger, if you're reading this you should know I'm already very grateful to you.
Well, to the point, this is my first mini-console game (do not judge me strictly only 15), I made the game for about 3-4 days, if you find any critical bugs, you can send them to me at my email zenator2007@gmail.com , thanks in advance))
